Online versions of the Demand Selection Task (Kool et al., 2010), as used by Patzelt, Kool, & Gershman (2019).

Note that this experiment is 50% shorter (4 blocks of 75 trials) than the original version of the Demand Selection Task (8 blocks of 75 trials).

This experiment has been written using version 4 of Josh deLeeuw's jsPsych toolbox (http://www.jspsych.org/).

In order to save the data, you will need to be able to connect to a SQL database on your server. The code has some default names for the tables it stores data in (e.g., dst_data, dst_subinfo, dst_subid), but feel free to change anything about the way the data storage is managed.
